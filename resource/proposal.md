# Web App Proposal: Teacher-Student Assignment Management

## Overview
This web app aims to streamline the process of sharing and managing assignments between teachers and students. Teachers can create and manage classrooms, upload assignments in doc or PDF format, and view student submissions. Students can join classrooms, download assignments, and submit their completed work.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:**
  - Framework: Next.js
  - State Management: Redux
  - UI Components: shadcn
- **Backend:**
  - Framework: Next.js API routes
  - Authentication: Clerk
  - ORM: Prisma
- **Database:**
  - Primary Option: Neon PostgreSQL
  - Alternative Options: MongoDB, Supabase
- **File Storage:**
  - Service: Uploadthing

## Database Schema
### User Model
```prisma
model User {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  email       String   @unique
  name        String?
  role        String   @default("student")  // 'teacher' or 'student'
  userClassrooms  UserClassroom[]
  createdClassrooms Classroom[] @relation("TeacherClassrooms")  // Classrooms created by the teacher
}
```

### Classroom Model
```prisma
model Classroom {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  name        String
  teacherId   String
  joinCode    String   @unique
  assignments Assignment[]
  submissions Submission[]
  userClassrooms UserClassroom[]
  teacher     User         @relation("TeacherClassrooms", fields: [teacherId], references: [id])  // Relation to the User model
}
```

### Assignment Model
```prisma
model Assignment {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  title       String
  description String?
  fileUrl     String
  classroomId String
  dueDate     DateTime
  submissions Submission[]
  classroom   Classroom @relation(fields: [classroomId], references: [id])
}
```

### Submission Model
```prisma
model Submission {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  assignmentId  String
  studentId     String
  classroomId   String
  fileUrl       String
  submittedAt   DateTime @default(now())
  assignment    Assignment @relation(fields: [assignmentId], references: [id])
  classroom     Classroom @relation(fields: [classroomId], references: [id])
  userClassroom UserClassroom @relation(fields: [studentId], references: [id])
}
```

### UserClassroom Model
```prisma
model UserClassroom {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId      String
  classroomId String
  user        User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  classroom   Classroom @relation(fields: [classroomId], references: [id])
  submissions Submission[]
}
```

## Features
### For Teachers
- Create and manage classrooms
- Upload assignments (doc or PDF)
- View and manage student submissions

### For Students
- Join classrooms using a join code
- Download assignments
- Submit completed assignments

## Implementation Plan

### User Authentication
- Integrate Clerk for user authentication
- Ensure secure authentication for teachers and students

### API Endpoints
- **Classroom Management:**
  - Create, read, update, delete classrooms
  - Join classroom using join code
- **Assignment Management:**
  - Create, read, update, delete assignments within a classroom
  - Upload and download assignment files using Uploadthing
- **Submission Management:**
  - Submit completed assignments
  - View submissions for each assignment

### Frontend Development
- **UI Components:**
  - Design user-friendly and accessible UI using shadcn components
- **State Management:**
  - Implement Redux for managing application state
- **File Handling:**
  - Implement file input for uploads and links/buttons for downloads

### Testing and Deployment
- **Testing:**
  - Write unit tests and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- **Deployment:**
  - Deploy the backend to Vercel
  - Ensure CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

## Security Considerations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS to secure data transmission
- Validate file uploads to prevent malicious files

## Conclusion
By following this proposal, we aim to develop a secure, scalable, and user-friendly web app that simplifies the process of managing and sharing assignments between teachers and students.
